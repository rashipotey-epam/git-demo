When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly
